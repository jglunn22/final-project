## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cereal Killer 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A slot machine thaat is cereal theme and that is played on cereal money.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan on using python and or unity possibly. The use of youtube tutorials will be untilized, but I plan to make it my own. 
The slot varible will be colorful with cereal traits. I hope to be able to make my own in some way. Maybe some features
that I can click to open it to bigger screen. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome that seems semi relistic is just the hope that I get a basic slot machine to run. I have little hope that it

I have a well developed slot machine that can have a ttal amount of cereal you can bet on. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will aquire the skills to program on a different server. Using pictures in coding more efficetly and just learning how to programs a slot machine and the inner workings of how how one works.

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have changed the sprites except for flag pole and alien. I have changed the background music. To me I feel like I have conqured teh world doing this. I have also changed the project from what it was orginally. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Add the pyramid, flagpole, vampire and possibly some other sound effects.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Just about everything. I have watched the videoes that follow the code given by the Harvad course, except it just sound like a bunch of words to me. I changed parts of the code and have seen how it changes. The addition of the pyramid and flag pole is seeming impossible. I am unable to figure out how to add it.
